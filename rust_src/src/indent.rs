/// WIDTH is the number of columns available to display text; this

/// corresponds to the actual number of available text columns.

/// OFFSETS is either nil or a cons cell (HSCROLL . TAB-OFFSET).
/// HSCROLL is the number of columns not being displayed at the left
/// margin; this is usually taken from a window's hscroll member.
/// TAB-OFFSET is the number of columns of the first tab that aren't
/// being displayed, perhaps because the line was continued within it.
/// If OFFSETS is nil, HSCROLL and TAB-OFFSET are assumed to be zero.
///
/// WINDOW is the window to operate on.  It is used to choose the
/// display table; if it is showing the current buffer, it is used
/// also for deciding which overlay properties apply.  Note that
/// `compute-motion' always operates on the current buffer.

///   (POS HPOS VPOS PREVHPOS CONTIN)
/// POS is the buffer position where the scan stopped.
/// VPOS is the vertical position where the scan stopped.
/// HPOS is the horizontal position where the scan stopped.
///
/// PREVHPOS is the horizontal position one character back from POS.
/// CONTIN is t if a line was continued after (or within) the previous character.
///
/// For example, to find the buffer position of column COL of line
/// LINE of a certain window, pass the window's starting location as
/// FROM and the window's upper-left coordinates as FROMPOS.  Pass the
/// buffer's (point-max) as TO, to limit the scan to the end of the
/// visible section of the buffer, and pass LINE and COL as TOPOS.
